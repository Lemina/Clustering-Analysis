I have included marijuana use and parental presence as input variables to my  classification tree model 
evaluating the experience with being expelled from school( the response variable).

Marijuana use (second input x1) separated the sample into two subgroups.

It showed that adolescents having smoked Marijuana and had not their parents present were more likely to be expelled from school
1867 from 2034. 
while those who have smoked and had their parents assistance were less likely to be expelled (167 individuals from 2034)

Adolescents who had not smoked Marijuana and had not their parents present were more likely to be expelled 528 from 606 individuals
 while those who have not smoked and their parents were present were less expelled from school (only 78 from 606)
